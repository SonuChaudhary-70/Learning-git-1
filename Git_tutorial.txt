Welcome in tuttorial of Git
What is Git ? anyone??

Git is a web based software which is free for all. It is a version control system.
It keeps track changes made by contributor and helps to revert back the changes if not works.

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

Thank You
